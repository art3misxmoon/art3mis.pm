## ♡ hi :>

i'm art3mis<span class="super">1</span>, a computer programmer based in
sf and nyc. i'm still becoming more experienced in software design, but
i'm having fun learning how to make better code and create cool designs!
i'm korean, indian, and japanese american and speak english and spanish.
i got my start with an intro to c++ class and spent some time working as
part of the [smmr software][smmr] collective with [FIGBERT][figb] and
[Jacob Neplokh][jnep]. i also worked on a
pretty cool research project][ucsc] on music and machine-learning with
uc santa cruz's computational media department. i'm the charismatic
leader of the anti-capital letter agenda<span class="super">2</span>,
and some of my favorite things are minecraft,
object-oriented programming<span class="super">3</span>, and korean
singer-producer [yaeji][yeji].

<span class="super">1</span>yes, like the ready player one character!

<span class="super">2</span>they're unnecessary, and this is much more
aesthetically pleasing. the revolution is here. radical anti-camel case
is where it's at. 

<span class="super">3</span>this is leftover from my java days- i just
find it satisfying, even though i've become disillusioned with java in
general.
