## ♡ hi :>

i'm art3mis<span class="super">1</span>, a bay area high schooler and
computer programmer. i'm still sort of new to software design and
haven't donemany personal programming projects, but i'm having fun
learning how to make better code and create cool designs! i'm korean,
indian, and japanese american and speak english and spanish. i got my
start with an intro to c++ class and am now working as part of the
[smmr software][smmr] collective with [FIGBERT][figb] and
[Jacob Neplokh][jnep]. i'm the charismatic leader of the anti-capital
letter agenda<span class="super">2</span>, and some of my favorite
things are minecraft, object-oriented programming
<span class="super">3</span>, and korean singer-producer [yaeji][yeji].

<span class="super">1</span>yes, like the ready player one character!

<span class="super">2</span>they're unnecessary, and this is much more
aesthetically pleasing. the revolution is here.

<span class="super">3</span>this is leftover from my java days- i just
find it satisfying, even though i've become disillusioned with java in
general.
